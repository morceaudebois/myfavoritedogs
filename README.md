My Favorite Dogs is a web app that allows you to make a list of your favorite dogs from a wide varitey of breeds. The project does a simple thing but aims to do it as best as it can, with beautiful high res photos and a smooth modern UI.

## Current state

As of may 2021, the project is usable but not "officially" launched. I am waiting for some photographers to get back to me to know if their photos can be used in the project.
