My Favorite Dogs is a web app that allows you to make a list of your favorite dogs from a wide varitey of breeds. The project does a simple thing but aims to do it as best as it can, with beautiful high res photos and a smooth modern UI.

My Favorite Dogs can be used [here](https://myfavoritedogs.tahoe.be/). Everything is working but isn't completely finished.

## Features

* Select your favorite dog breeds and rearrange them
* Remembers your selection through local storage
* Save your list on the database and get a dedicated link
* Share your list on social media
* Credits page with name of the dog, photographers and their links

## Photos

The site uses free photos from Unsplash, Pixabay or Wikipedia as well as some of my own photos. All credits can be found [here](https://myfavoritedogs.tahoe.be/credits.php).

__I'm always looking for better photos__, if you think you have some that would represent a breed nicely, please get in touch at mail@tahoe.be. I'd love for you to participate to the project! 

Here's a description of the ideal photo:
- full body shot of the dog either standing or sitting, with the recognisable traits of their breed clearly visible
- professional looking, shot with a real camera or a good phone with nice lightning conditions and a shallow depth of field
- ideally, the dog should be at their best and not have undergone physical alterations, like cut tail, ears or balls

Some examples of ideal photos include [this](https://myfavoritedogs.tahoe.be/src/images/medium/tahoe-bZYJ89REqIE-unsplash.jpg), [this](https://myfavoritedogs.tahoe.be/src/images/medium/jayalekshman-sj-UF3T6qtjelM-unsplash.jpg) or [this](https://myfavoritedogs.tahoe.be/src/images/medium/tarkan.jpg).

## Built with

* Styled with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
* Made with vanilla PHP/JS & MySQL

## Current state

As of may 2021, the project is usable but not "officially" launched. I am waiting for some photographers to get back to me to know if their photos can be used in the project.
