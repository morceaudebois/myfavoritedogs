## üì∑ Photos

This project has a emphasis on quality photography. The site uses free photos from Unsplash, Pixabay or Wikipedia as well as some of my own photos. All credits can be found [here](https://myfavoritedogs.tahoe.be/credits.php).

__I'm always looking for better photos__, if you think you have some that would represent a breed nicely, please get in touch at mail@tahoe.be. I'd love for you to participate to the project! 

Here's a description of the ideal photo:
- full body shot of the dog either standing or sitting, with the recognisable traits of their breed clearly visible
- professional looking, shot with a real camera or a good phone with nice lightning conditions and a shallow depth of field
- ideally, the dog should be at their best and not have undergone physical alterations, like cut tail, ears or balls

Some examples of ideal photos include:
